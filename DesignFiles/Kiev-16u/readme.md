Kiev 16u Lenses
--

If you're shooting with a Blackmagic Pocket camera, you've probably heard about the lenses from the Kiev 16U, a Russian (well, Ukranian...when the cameras were made, Ukraine was part of the USSR) 16MM camera.  They come with a 3-slot turret, loaded with 3 prime lenses.

Unlike Bolex H16's, where the turret may be loaded with any number of lenses, Kiev 16Us all come with the same set of 3:

* MIR-11M 12mm/2
* VEGA-7-1M 20mm/2
* Tair-41M 50mm/2

A little googling will lead you to a bunch of reviews and test footage.  The 12mm is a touch dark in the corners.  The 50mm is a really nice lens (though on a 16mm frame, 50mm is telephoto), with a many-bladed iris, with a nearly round opening, for nice, circular bokeh.

The most likely source for these lenses is EBay.

You'll also need an MFT adapter.  They're machined by RAFCamera, and run about $50.  I bought my set of lenses from him, including the adataper.  Shipped from Belarus in about a week.

If you're shopping, a couple things to note:

* The "-M" suffix is for the Kiev 16u lenses.  The same lenses are also around in the Krasnogorsk Bayonet mount, taking a completely different adapter, and having F/2.2 apertures.  Look carefully for the threads in the pictures - they're usually kinda brassy 
   
## Gears

The files here were done for my lenses.  They may need adjustment for your own lenses.

Apparently these were in production for a long time, and there are some differences over their lifetime.  My lenses are "Zebra" style, with exposed, shiny aluminum rectangles on the aperture and focus rings.  I've also seen some all black versions, usually coming from Poland.


The OD of each gear is the same: 2.564"

The ID I measures on each focus ring:

* 12mm: 44.3mm 
* 20mm: 44.44mm
* 50mm #1: 46 (+/- 0.1)  not entirely round?  45.9 to 46.05
* 50mm #2: 46 (+/- 0.1)  not entirely round?  45.9 to 46.05

## Notes on cutting

First gears were cut from clear acrylic, for the 20mm.

ID set to 44.44 caused actual ID (allowing for kerf?) to be more like 44.7mm.  Adjusting downward by a bit, to 44.1mm, seems to fit better.  Same gear is fitting the 12mm and 20mm.

Cutter adjustments: Was doing 3 passes.  First 2 at 10 % speed, 100% power, 5000 Hz.  With those, the ID hole was cut, but teeth were still stuck.  3rd pass of just the teeth, raised to 25% speed, cut it nicely.

Only limited luck with black delrin yet.  Best results:
3.3mm black delrin, 20 % speed, 100% power, 500 Hz.  4 passes.
One issue is that the material warps as it heats up.  Another issue is that it wants to burn if the laser moves too slow, making the warping even worse.
