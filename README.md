Laser Cut Lens Gears
==================

*NOTE: all of this work is preliminary.  Nothing here has been completed or tested.*

Resources for laser cut lens gears, starting with .8 pitch, but the sky is the limits. 

### Inkscape notes

There's a gear generator in *extensions->render->gear*.
The magic number for circular pitch is 8.835 px. (see notebook on 3/24/2014).

If you were really on top of things, you'd generate a path that traces around the outside of gear, so that the laser kerf skirted the outer edge of the gear.
